# Having Cache Issues?

If you're not seeing the latest updates to this website, try these solutions:

## Quick Fixes

### 1. Hard Refresh
- **Windows/Linux**: Press `Ctrl + F5` or `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + R`
- **Alternative**: Hold `Shift` and click the refresh button

### 2. Developer Tools Method
1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### 3. Private Browsing
- Open the site in Incognito/Private mode
- This bypasses all browser caching

## Why This Happens

Your browser saves copies of websites to load them faster. During development, this can show old versions instead of new updates.

## For Developers

If you're developing this site:
- Use browser dev tools with "Disable cache" enabled
- Test in private/incognito mode
- Use hard refresh after making changes
