# My Flutter Development Journey

## Project Timeline & Personal Story

### üöÄ The Beginning - Marga Darshan (May 2023)
**My Very First Flutter App**

When I first arrived in Pokhara for my studies at Paschimanchal Campus, I faced a common problem that many newcomers experience - I had no idea about the public transportation system. Simple questions like "Where do I catch the bus?", "How much is the fare?", and "Which bus goes where?" were daily challenges.

Instead of just struggling with these issues, I decided to solve them through technology. This led to the creation of **Marga Darshan** - my very first Flutter application.

**What I learned:**
- Flutter basics from scratch
- Problem-solving through code
- UI/UX design fundamentals
- The satisfaction of solving real-world problems

### üß† Building Confidence - Simply Me (2023)
**My First Published App**

After gaining confidence from Marga Darshan, I wanted to challenge myself with something more complex. I developed **Simply Me**, an MBTI-based personality test app that would later become my first published application on the Play Store in 2025.

**What I learned:**
- Complex app logic and algorithms
- User data handling and processing
- App store publishing process
- Building upon previous knowledge

### üîí Security Focus - SafeConnect (Nov 2023 - Apr 2024)
**Minor Project**

With two successful projects under my belt, I tackled a more ambitious challenge - creating a secure, anonymous chat application with end-to-end encryption.

**What I learned:**
- Mobile security implementation
- Encryption and privacy-focused development
- Advanced Flutter features
- Anonymous user systems

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Under Pressure - Tokema (June 15, 2024)
**24-Hour Hackathon**

A high-pressure 24-hour hackathon where I developed a digital tourism solution. The challenge taught me rapid development and working under tight deadlines.

**What I learned:**
- Rapid prototyping
- Working under pressure
- Quick decision-making
- MVP development approach

### ‚å®Ô∏è Going Live - TypeMobo (July - Dec 2024)
**Second Published App**

My most ambitious project yet - a comprehensive typing speed test app with real-time multiplayer features, global leaderboards, and team competitions.

**What I learned:**
- Real-time systems and multiplayer functionality
- Advanced backend integration
- Performance optimization
- Complex feature implementation

### üè¢ Professional Experience - NRB-LMS (Feb - Apr 2025)

Working at Nepal Rastra Bank gave me enterprise-level development experience, creating a complete library management system for a major financial institution.

**What I learned:**
- Enterprise software development
- Professional development standards
- Working with stakeholders
- Large-scale system architecture
